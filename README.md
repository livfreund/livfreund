## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Olivia Freund! I graduated in May of 2025 from the University of Northern Iowa with my bachelors degree in economics & business analytics as well as a minor in computer science. 
Next, starting in fall of 2025, I will be working to pursue my Master's degree in Software Development from Boston University. I am very passionate
about all things software dev/eng & innovation, and I am so excited to begin working in a field I love! Any projects I have completed can be found at my GitHub under the 
username _livfreund_ and my LinkedIn is linked in my bio.
